# Project Administration and Management

## Project Overview
**Thesis**: Daily and Hourly Electricity Price Forecasting Using Machine Learning Approaches  
**Student**: Mohammad Azimpour  
**Program**: MSc in Electrical Engineering  
**University**: Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)  
**Duration**: November 2025 - [Expected Completion]  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/M0W3ZY/EnergyMarket-PriceCast

## Project Management

### Timeline and Milestones
- **Phase 1** (Months 1-3): Literature Review and Data Collection
- **Phase 2** (Months 4-6): Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- **Phase 3** (Months 7-9): Model Implementation and Training
- **Phase 4** (Months 10-12): Evaluation and Analysis
- **Phase 5** (Months 13-15): Thesis Writing and Final Submission

### Risk Management
**Identified Risks:**
1. **Data Access Issues**: PJM API limitations or data unavailability
   - *Mitigation*: Backup datasets from ERCOT/Nord Pool
2. **Computational Resources**: Training large models on limited hardware
   - *Mitigation*: Cloud computing resources (Google Colab, AWS)
3. **Timeline Delays**: Complex model optimization taking longer than expected
   - *Mitigation*: Modular approach, weekly checkpoints, scope adjustment

### Quality Assurance
- Code review standards
- Documentation requirements
- Testing protocols
- Reproducibility checks

## Collaboration

### Supervisor Communication
- Weekly progress meetings
- Monthly milestone reviews
- Draft chapter submissions
- Final thesis review schedule

## Version Control

### Git Workflow
- **Main Branch**: Stable, production-ready code
- **Develop Branch**: Integration branch for features
- **Feature Branches**: Individual model implementations
- **Release Branches**: Thesis submission versions

### Commit Message Standards
```
type(scope): description

feat(models): add LSTM implementation
fix(data): resolve missing value handling
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(evaluation): add unit tests for metrics
```

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Function docstrings with parameters and returns
- Class documentation with purpose and usage
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Type hints for all functions

### Research Documentation
- Literature review summaries
- Experiment documentation
- Result interpretation notes
- Publication drafts

## Ethical Considerations

### Data Usage
- Public data sources only
- Proper attribution for data sources
- Compliance with data usage agreements
- No real-time trading applications

### Research Integrity
- Transparent methodology
- Honest reporting of results
- Proper citation of sources
- Reproducible research practices

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
