# Daily and Hourly Electricity Price Forecasting Using Machine Learning Approaches

## Thesis Project Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation and research for an MSc thesis in Electrical Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic).

**Research Focus**: Developing a unified machine learning framework for electricity price forecasting in the PJM Day-Ahead Market, with emphasis on model comparison, explainability, and feature fusion.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Model Comparison**: 11 machine learning models evaluated under identical conditions
- **Multi-Resolution Forecasting**: Hourly (24-hour ahead) and daily aggregated predictions
- **Explainable AI**: SHAP-based model interpretation and feature importance analysis
- **Feature Fusion**: Integration of exogenous variables (weather, load, calendar features)
- **Volatility Analysis**: Specialized evaluation for high-volatility periods
- **Reproducible Research**: Complete pipeline with configuration management

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Git
- 8GB+ RAM recommended

### Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Windows - Run the quick setup launcher
scripts\START_SETUP.bat

# Linux/macOS - Make executable and run
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh

# Or use the Python setup script
python scripts/quick_setup.py
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/M0W3ZY/EnergyMarket-PriceCast.git
cd EnergyMarket-PriceCast

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Validate setup
python scripts/check_setup.py
```

### Data Setup
1. Download PJM data from [Data Miner 2](https://dataminer2.pjm.com)
2. Fetch weather data from [NOAA](https://ncdc.noaa.gov)
3. Obtain fuel/renewable data from [EIA](https://eia.gov/opendata)
4. Place raw data in `data/raw/` directory

### Running Experiments
```bash
# Train all models
python -m electricity_price_forecast.models.train_models

# Generate forecasts
python -m electricity_price_forecast.models.predict

# Run data collection
python -m electricity_price_forecast.data_pipeline.collect_data

# Test installation
python -m pytest tests/
```

2. **Multi-Resolution**: How does accuracy differ between hourly and daily horizons?
3. **Feature Impact**: To what extent do exogenous variables improve performance?
4. **Volatility Handling**: How do models perform in high-volatility periods vs. normal?
5. **Explainability**: Which features contribute most, and how does SHAP enhance interpretability?
6. **Efficiency**: What are the computational trade-offs between models?
